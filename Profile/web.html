    <p>        Yanfei enjoys appraisal, reading and is very knowledgeable on many topics — most notably the law, due
         to her career as a legal advisor. With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her 
         clients should they have trouble in different parts of Liyue. She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws
         of the other nations in Teyvat — though, she notes Fontaine's law to be the most difficult. She is well known 
         by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners
         her many a client across the nation. Even Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, states that Yanfei's memorization
         of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself.[2]
         When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument.
         Although she can handle any case, she dislikes having to deal with civil suits. As many in Liyue do, Yanfei places 
         a high value on the importance of contracts, though she is noted to place a higher value on them more than the average 
        person due to the nature of her job.
        
    </p>
    <p>  Despite having the blood of an adeptus in her veins, Yanfei is not particularly concerned about her adeptal heritage
         and is one of the few who did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis due to being born in an era of peace. 
         She is very active and often talks a lot, a stark contrast to her father, who Madame Ping knew to be more solemn.
          She spends her time much like an average human does, and unlike most adepti, Yanfei doesn't consider herself above mortals in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yanfei enjoys tofu because of its versatility and availability. She dislikes cold food and she rarely eats them since her father told her
        that food was best served hot.
